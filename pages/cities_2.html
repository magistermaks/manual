<h3>cities</h3>

<p>
	Cities allow you to create a safe colony (a one that can't be disconnected from you). They are immune to bombs and similary to the capital
	can be used to summon a unit every turn. They can be taken in all the same ways the capital can, when that happens a ring of terrain around it is granted to the
	conqueror. In a case that the city is the last ramaining connection of a colony conquering it, grants the conqueror the terrain of the whole colonly.

		<p class="smaller">
			Taking a city carves a ring ot terrain around it for you. Only tiles already owned by some other player are granted in this way (you won't gain any no man's territory).
			This mechanic takes tiles from all players in range, not only the orginal owner of the city.

<h3>fortresses</h3>

<p>
	Fortresses allow you to connect a colony. They work in much the same way as cities, but can't be used to summon units.
	Upon being conquered they also grant you a ring of terrain (or the whole colony if they are the last link).
	You can't move your capital into a fortress.

	A fortress can be upgraded into a city, learn more in the <a href="#building_2">building</a> chapter
