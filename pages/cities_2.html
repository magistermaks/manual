<h3>cities</h3>

<p>
	Cities allow you to create a safe colony (a one that can't be disconnected from you). They are immune to bombs and similarly to the capital
	can be used to summon a unit every turn. They can be taken in all the same ways the capital can, when that happens a ring of terrain around it is granted to the
	conqueror. In a case that the city is the last remaining connection of a colony conquering it, grants the conqueror the terrain of the whole colony.

<h3>protected range</h3>

<p>
	Protected range is a ring of terrain around cities, fortresses and capitals in which all players except for the owner of said
	center of power, have impeded ability to colonize both militarily and normally. If a \2\ is rolled in this range
	the dice must be rerolled until a different number is obtained.

			Another function of the protected range (shown on the image to the left) is that when you
			conquere a city, fortress, or a capital that whole ring of terrain is aditionally granted to you.
			Only tiles already owned by <em>some</em> other player are granted in this way (you won't gain any no man's territory).

<h3>fortresses</h3>

<p>
	Fortresses allow you to connect a colony. They work in much the same way as cities, but can't be used to summon units.
	Upon being conquered they also grant you a ring of terrain (or the whole colony if they are the last link).
	You can't move your capital into a fortress. 
	A fortress can be upgraded into a city, learn more in the <a href="#building_2">building</a> chapter.
