	Allows you to produce bombs (1b for 10m), nuclear weapons (1n for 100m + 1u), and dirty bombs (1r for 1b + 1u).
	One bomb factory can produce 1 thing per turn, the produced articles are <em>NOT</em> immediately available for use, they are considered ready
	right after your turn ends, whichg means that, for example, that they can be send to another player or used by a Shield without problem.

	Allows you to shot others (or yourself) with bombs (b), nuclear weapons (n), and dirty bombs (r) if they are within range
	(you can count diagonally) of 10 tiles on a A5 map, 20 tiles on a A4 map, 30 on a A3 one, and so on.
	One launcher can be used once per turn.

	A shield is used to protect yourself from bombings coming from abroad, it can shoot down bombs both
	normal and dirty, but is powerless against incoming nuclear warheads. When a bomb enters the protected area
	and the owner of the shield <em>wants</em> to shoot it down one bomb will be used up and the incoming bomb will be destroyed.

			Shield protects an area in Manhattan distance of 5 tiles from itself (marked on the image with a gray line).
			Be aware that because of the way bombs work even though the \B\ is inside the protected area it can still be destroyed
			by shooting the <b>A</b> point. To make sure your buildings are safe place them at a distance of 4 tiles from the shield, like the two factories.

	Works similarly to cities and the capital but doesn't allow for new units to be summoned. You can upgrade it to a city later by paying an additional 60m.
	Unlike cities, you cannot move your capital there, learn more in the <a href="#cities">cities</a> chapter.
