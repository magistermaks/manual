<h1>THE CAPITAL AND CITIES</h1>
<h3>and how to conquer them</h3>

<p>
	The capital is a city, and the most important place in your country, you have to protect it to avoid being conquered.
	Surround it with units and always keep a distance between it and the borders of your country.

			There are multiple ways to take over a country, you can use military colonization to take any of the four tiles of its capital,
			it works similarly to colonizing buildings but you take over the whole country. You can also employ a direct nuclear strike at any of the four
			tiles of the capital to destroy it. In that case, the whole country becomes a disconected colony and you can start taking it
			over with normal colonization.

			You can also besiege cities, by blocking all the empty tiles around them with your units. If the city has a contact with water, lava, mountain slopes, or radiation
			those tiles can be ignored. Alternatively you can also use radiation to block all the tiles, the city should then be treated as destroyed and covered with radiation.

<p>
	Making a move that results in any of the tiles around your capital getting blocked with radiation is not allowed.
</p>

<p>
	If the country whose capital was taken has some other city (occupied capitals don't count) the capital moves to it. The city is redrawned
	to look like a capital, and the reverse is done with the old capital. You can also move a capital on your own accord if you want, but that can
	be the only thing you do in your turn (no income, no new units, no anything).
</p>

<h3>occupied capitals</h3>

<p>
	An occupied capital is created when a country is conquered (see the picture below), it allows the occupier to summon new units like from a normal city.

			Occupied capital retains the original symbol and can't be used to create colonies.
			If at any point a connection between the occupier and the territory on which the occupied capital is located is severed the original country regains
			independence and returns to the game with all the territory now connected to its regained capital.
