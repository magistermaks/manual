<h1>COLONIES</h1>
<h3>the sun shall never set over your empire</h3>

<p>
	Colony is a territory not <em>directly</em> connected with the rest of the country but with, for example, a bridge over a river.

			Your colony needs to always stay connected.
			You can use bridges (as on the image), piers (see <a href="#water">water</a>) or place a city/fortress inside (see <a href="#cities">cities</a>).
			The cities and/or fortresses are the safest way to ensure that your colony never gets disconnected.

<h3>disconnected colonies</h3>

<p>
	When a colony gets disconnected for all intents and purposes it should be treated as no man's land. You can't use the buildings located there,
	build new ones or demolish old ones, get materials from local mines, your units move as if outside of your country, you can't equip armor, <strong>it can be colonized
	with normal colonization</strong>, etc. But once you regain connection with the lost territory everything gets back to normal. Note that as a disconnected colony
	may be treated a part of your normal territory that was separated from you, for example, by exchanging it or being cut off with military colonization.

<p>
	Borders don't connect diagonally!
