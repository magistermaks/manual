<h1>COLONIES</h1>
<h3>the sun shall never set over your empire</h3>

<p>
	Colony is a territory not <em>directly</em> connected with the rest of the country but, 
	for example, with a bridge over a river, piers or cities.

			Your colony needs to always stay connected.
			You can use bridges (as on the image), piers (see <a href="#water">water</a>) or place a city/fortress inside (see <a href="#cities">cities</a>).
			The cities and/or fortresses are the safest way to ensure that your colony never gets disconnected.

<h3>disconnected colonies</h3>

<p>
	When a colony gets disconnected for all intents and purposes it should be treated as no man's land. You can't use the buildings located there,
	build new ones, demolish old ones, nor get materials from the mines. 
	Your units move as if outside of your country, and you can't equip armor on them.
	One important difference is that it can be colonized with <em>both miliatry and normal</em> colonization. 
	Once you regain connection with the lost territory everything gets back to normal. 
</p>

<p>
	Note that as a disconnected colony
	may also be treated a part of your normal territory that was separated from you, for example, by exchanging it or being cut off with military colonization.
	It's also worth remembering here that borders don't connect diagonally!
