		<p>
			Warzone is a paper-and-pencil strategy game where you complete for resources. All you need to play is a automatic pencil,
			eraser (preferably small or also automatic) a single K6 dice and a notebook with grid paper where the game map will be located.
		</p>

		<p>
			The main goal of the game is to survive, everything else is just a mean to an end.
			But the neat part is that there is no winning, or losing for that matter. Countries may rise and fall
			but players are never considered 100% gone, every country can be resurrected if there is a will to do so.
			Because of that even if everyone is conquered the last players is not a winner, as there are no losers.
			Conquering everyone would not be a victory but a failure of the world to stop that.
			This game is about the journey, the politics along the way, not the goal.
		</p>

		<p>
			The last player in a round (the one who does his turn last) is the Game Master, they are responsible for keeping the game running.
			To his duties belong executing trades, incrementing the turn counter as well as some other minor things.
		</p>

		<p>
			Every player has to choose a symbol from the top row that will identify them (the ones in the bottom row show how a unit of
			that symbol looks with armor equipped).

			To start playing you will also need a map, you can either use on of the publicly available ones
			and copy it into your notebook, or design your own, but know that it's not so simple to do right.
			After the map is drawn put away your pen you won't need it anymore everything after that point should be done with a pencil.
