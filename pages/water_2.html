	<b>Damage:</b> When a ship is hit with ammunition it loses 1 armor, when that runs out it loses one tier
	(and all the resources that don't fit anymore) when the tier gets to 0 the ship sinks. If a bomb (or torpedo) hits a ship it immediately sinks.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Movement:</b> Ships can move only on water tiles <i>(duh!)</i> it can swim under bridges but can't stop there, it can however both swim though and stop on tiles with
	coastal defenses. The number of tiles a ship can traverse in a single turn is determined by its speed value from the table above.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Defences:</b> A ship <em>can</em> stay on the same water tile the coastal defenses are located. but it can't land units
	nor build a pier there. Remember that there can be multiple coastal defenses on one water tile (up to the theoretical 4) but that is still treated
	as a single structure and can be destroyed with a single ammunition.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Landing:</b> Landing can be performed only when the ship touches land (no coastal defenses between them).
	It allows you to get max 4 units from the ship onto the ground 1 tile (with diagonals) from the ship. You can also
	load max 4 units from those tiles back onto the ship, players without a country can also exchange resources with
	units standing in this area and the ship.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Piers:</b> A ship can build a pier next to itself. When you build a pier it automatically grants
	you 1 tile of territory, irrespective of who owned that tile before. Learn more in <a href="#building">building</a> chapter.
	If that tile is ever taken by another player the symbol on the pier changes respectively to match the new owner.

			The dots show where the respective ships can land troops,

<p>
	<b>Resources:</b> While the ship is docked you can move any resources between the country that owns the pier or hearbor and your ship.
	You can also put people on a ship by moving them "into" the pier or harbor.
	If you don't want your units on a ship anymore you can do the same things in reverse.
	When two ships touch each other you can move any resources
	(and units) between them. Remember that you can only put unarmored units on ships. There are no limits on transferring resources and units.
	For a ship to be able to move it must have at least one unit on board, if a unit of another country tries to enter an empty ship
	the ship becomes theirs.
