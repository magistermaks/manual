<h1>STATISTICS</h1>
<h3>player statistics</h3>

<p>
	Statistics is a separate from the main map page or section where all the information
	about the resources held by all players is stored. They are public for all to see and modify.
	Every player is given a row similar to the one below:
</p>

<img loading="lazy" class="image spaced" src="images/stats.png">

<div class="columns">
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>A</b> is for ammunition</li>
			<li><b>Z</b> is for armor</li>
			<li><b>B</b> is for bombs</li> <!--you want it?-->
			<li><b>N</b> is for nuclear weapons</li>
			<li><b>U</b> is for uranium</li>
			<li><b>R</b> is for dirty bombs</li>

			<li>The number after the plus sign is the income (the number of mines)</li>
			<li>The number between the square brackets is the material count in a "local warehouse"</li>
			<li>"Xam Empire" is the country name</li>
			<li>"Bob" is the player name</li>
			<li>The arrow in the top-right corner is described in more details in the <a href="#trading">trading</a> chapter.</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		And the boxed "1" followed by an "13" indicates 13m in non-local warehouse #1.
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
		All the resources (apart from the materials stored in non-local warehouses) are tied to
		the player not the country, which means that you cannot be robbed of them even when your whole country is conquered.
		</p>

		<p>
			If your country is conquered the warehouse section of the row should be crossed out with a large X like so:
			(as with the rest of the game use a pencil not a pen)

<h3>warehouses</h3>

<p>
	Local warehouse has the maximum capacity of 10m by default and 20m if you bought the capacity upgrade in the parliament (\P\).
	To be able to build more expensive buildings you will need something a bit more roomy - a fully-fledged warehouse,
	learn more about that in the <a href="#building">building</a> chapter.
</p>

<p>
	You can freely move materials between all your warehouses at any point of your turn.
</p>

<h3>parliment</h3>

<p>
	The upgrades bought by individual players can be seen on the parliment page/section, by looking at the symbols drown next to the upgrade
	icons.
