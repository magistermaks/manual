	A shield is used to protect yourself from bombings coming from abroad, it can shoot down bombs both
	normal and dirty, but is powerless against incoming nuclear warheads. When a bomb enters the protected area
	and the owner of the shield <em>wants</em> to shoot it down one bomb will be used up and the incoming bomb will be destroyed.

			Shield protects an area in Manhattan distance of 5 tiles from itself (marked on the image with a gray line).
			Be aware that because of the way bombs work even though the \B\ is inside the protected area it can still be destroyed
			by shooting the <b>A</b> point. To make sure your buildings are safe place them at a distance of 4 tiles from the shield, like the two factories.
