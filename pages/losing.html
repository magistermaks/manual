<h1>LOSING</h1>
<h3>viva la revolution</h3>

<p>
	Loosing the capital doesn't end the game for you - you may lose all the territory but you can still fight.
	for the time of you being without a capital some special abilities activate for all your units.
</p>

<p>
	You can now equip armor anywhere on the map, move unarmored units onto no man's land, trade with other countries
	by having at least one of your units on their territory and make kamikaze attacks! Also all your units gain one extra movement point
	so that they have 6 in total (equal to having the tactical maps upgrade).
</p>

<p>
	If you have less than 12 units you most likely won't be able to retake the capital (and even with that it's quite
	unlikely) so you will need to find some "patron" to help you regain the fatherland by taking it from the occupier and transferring it back to you.
	Even when you have 0 people you can still return to the game if some other player retakes your capital and decides to give it back to you.
	Remember that this kind of territory transfers need to be agreed upon from both sides - you need to agree to your capital being returned to you.
</p>

<h3>kamikaze attacks</h3>

<p>
	The name is quite self-explanatory. If you own any bombs (normal, dirty, or nuclear) you
	can now detonate one of your units with them! (grim!)
