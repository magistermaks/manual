<h1>BUILDING</h1>
<h3>list and description of all buildings</h3>

<p>
	You can build buildings only inside of your country, all buildings require some amount of materials to construct.
	When you construct any structure (like a factory, warehouse or bridge) you can use it starting with the next turn,
	(The building is considered working right after you end your turn, this detail can make a big difference when it comes to Shields!).
	Also note that buildings cannot be moved after you place them (of course as long as you didn't end your turn it's fine to change your mind about anything). 
	You can't build <em>on</em> units, move them out of the way first if you want to construct something where they stand.
<p>

<p>
	You can demolish buildings to immediately (in the same turn) get back 40% of their 
	original price (rounded down) but only if they are not in use (you can't demolish a factory while also producing ammunition) AND you have 
	to have some space to store the materials - you can't destroy a building if <em>none</em> of the materials would fit into any warehouse.

<p>
	Allows you to store up to 100m. Every warehouse has a unique for its country number (from 1 to 9) in the empty slot on its right side. See <a href="#statistics">statistics</a>
	to learn how to denote materials being stored in one. You can have a maximum of 9 warehouses, and if by some chance you happen to gain more it immediately collapses
	and the contents are lost. You cannot demolish a non-empty warehouse.
</p>

<p>
	Warehouse is usually the first building you will want to construct as it allows you to gather over 10 materials, it is also one of the few buildings you are allowed to rotate as you wish.

<p>
	Allows you to produce ammunition (1a for 1m) and armor (1z for 1m).
	One factory can produce 2 things per turn, the produced articles are immediately available for use (in the same turn).

<p>
	Allows you to buy and use upgrades. Once you buy one you will need at least one
	parliament in your country for the upgrade to remain active. See the full list of available 
	upgrades in the <a href="#upgrades">upgrades</a> chapter.
