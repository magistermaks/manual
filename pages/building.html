<h1>BUILDING</h1>
<h3>list and description of all buildings</h3>

<p>
	You can build buildings only inside of your country, all buildings require some amount of materials to construct.
	When you construct a building (like a factory or a warehouse) you can use it starting with the next turn, not immidietly. Also note that buildings cannot
	be moved after you place them (of course as long as you didn't end your move it's fine to change your mind about anything). You can also demolish buildings
	to immediately get back 40% of their price (rounded down) if they are not in use (you can't demolish a factory while also producing ammunition) AND you have some space
	to store the materials - you can't destroy a building if <em>none</em> of the materials would fit into any warehouse. You can't build over units, move them out of the way first.

<p>
	Allows you to store 100m. Every warehouse has a unique for its country number (from 1 to 9) in the empty slot on its right side. See <a href="#statistics">statistics</a>
	to learn how to denote materials being stored in one. You can have a maximum of 9 of those, if by some chance you happen to gain one more it immediately collapses
	and the contents are lost. You cannot demolish a non-empty warehouse. This is usually the first building you will want to construct as it allows you to gather over 10 materials.
	This is the only building you are allowed to rotate.

<p>
	Allows you to produce ammunition (1a for 1m) and armor (1z for 1m).
	One factory can produce 2 things per turn, the produced articles are immediately available for use (in the same turn).

</table>

<p>
	Allows you to produce bombs (1b for 10m), nuclear weapons (1n for 100m + 1u), and dirty bombs (1r for 1b + 1u).
	One bomb factory can produce 1 thing per turn, the produced articles are <em>NOT</em> immediately available for use, they are considered ready
	right after your turn ends.

<p>
	Allows you to shot others (or yourself) with bombs (b), nuclear weapons (n), and dirty bombs (r) if they are within range
	(you can count diagonally) of 10 tiles on a A5 map, 20 tiles on a A4 map, 30 on a A3 one, and so on.
	One launcher can be used once per turn.
