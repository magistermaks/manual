<h1>COLONIZATION</h1>
<h3>the two types of colonization</h3>

<p>
	The basics of using colonization where outlined in the <a href="#basics">basics</a> chapter, here it will be described in more detail.
	To colonize with a unit that unit doesn't necessarily have to stand at the border,
	for example it can stand one tile away but then your only chance to gain anything with such a unit to to roll a \2\.
	Remember that borders don't connect diagonally!
</p>

<p>
	There are two types of colonization: normal - used to take territory that didn't belong to anyone else before,
	and military that can be used to steal (or as some may call it "justly regain") territory owned by other players.
</p>

<p>
	If after colonization any of the neighboring tiles (touching vertically or horizontally) itself only neighbors
	with tiles that can't be colonized (like water, lava, radiation, or the map border), or from one side with anther player and
	from three others with you, but is itself not owned by anyone then that tile should be granted to you additionally.
</p>

<p>
	If you manage to encircle some territory (that is - there is a ring of your territory around it, be it with normal or military colonization)
	you gain all of it, unless the territory belongs to another player and has a city, fortress or the country capital inside. The encircled territory
	can contain some uncolonizable tiles like water, lava, or radiation.
</p>

<p>
	The military colonization can even be used to completely conquer a nation (see <a href="#cities">cities</a>), but it does have a price - it requires
	a payment of 2 ammunition to perform. In all aspects other than the cost and implications it works very much in the same way
	the normal one does, but can't be used to gain any "not owned" territory (that can only be done with the normal one). This
	colonization is also blocked by units of other players - you can't gain the tiles on which the units are located nor the ones behind them
	(that can only apply if you would roll a \2\).

			If you colonize at the end of a bridge you will also be able to gain tiles on the other side,
			notice that you gain tiles around the colonizing unit as per-usual. If the \UNIT_CROSS\ was to roll a \2\
			they would also get the tile marked with a pink dot. This mechanic also works with military colonization.
