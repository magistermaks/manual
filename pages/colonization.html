<h1>COLONIZATION</h1>
<h3>the two types of colonization</h3>

<p>
	The basics of using colonization where outlined in the <a href="#basics">basics</a> chapter, here it will be described in more detail.
	Borders don't connect diagonally!
</p>

<p>
	There are two types of colonization: normal - used to take territory that didn't belong to any one else before,
	and military that can be used to steal (or as some may call it "justly regain") territory owned by other players.
</p>

<p>
	If after colonization one (or more) of the neighbouring tiles (touching vertically or horizontally) itself neighbours
	from 3 sides with you and from one with water, lava, or another player but is itself not owned by anyone then that tile should be granted to you
	aditionally.
</p>

<p>
	If you manage to encircle some teritory (that is - there is a ring of your teritory around it, be it with normal or military colonizations)
	you gain all of it, unless the teritory belongs to another player and has a city, fortress or the country capital inside. The encircled territory
	can contain some natural uncolonizable tiles like water, lava, or radiation.
</p>

<p>
	The military colonization can even be used to completely conquer a nation (see <a href="#cities">cities</a>), but it does have a price - it requires
	a payment of 2 ammunition to perform. In all aspects other than the cost and implications it works very much in the same way
	the normal one does, but can't be used to gain any "not owned" territory (that can only be done with the normal one). This
	colonization is also blocked by units of other players - you can't gain the tiles on which the units are located nor the ones behind them
	(that can only apply if you would roll a \2\).

			If you colonize at the end of a bridge you will also be able to gain tiles on the other side,
			notice that you gain tiles around the colonizing unit as per-usual. If the \UNIT_CROSS\ was to roll a \2\
			they would also get the tile marked with a pink dot. This mechanic also works with military colonization.
