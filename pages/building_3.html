	You can summon a new unit every turn from it in the same way you do it from the capital.
	Also similarly to capitals it cannot be destroyed by shooting with ammunition nor bombing, only a nuclear strike can destroy it.
	It cannot be demolished once build. When occupied it grants control over some of the terrain surrounding it. Cities can be used to
	connect a colony with the rest of the country, learn more in the <a href="#cities">cities</a> chapter.

	Allows you to construct new ships and place them on the neighbouring water tiles.
	When building a harbor it must be placed next to at least one tile of water.

	Piers are a 1x1 structure that can be built on water, with one side touching the land, 
	used to connect a colony with the rest of the country. 
	It can be constructed extraterritorially by your ships. When built, it automatically grants you
	one tile of terrain (the piece of land it faces). If that piece of terrain is taken from you by 
	another player, the symbol on the pier changes, and the pier stops being yours. 
	Ships on water tiles neighbouring with a pier are to be considered <em>docked</em>.
