<h1>UNITS</h1>
<h3>moving and shooting</h3>

<p>
	Every unit can either move or shoot every turn. You can also equip or unequip armor from any unit within your
	borders at any point of the turn.
</p>

<br>
<h3>moving</h3>

<p>
	Every unit has 5 movement points available (or 6 if you have a parliament and the "tactical maps" upgrade - learn more in the
	<a href="#upgrades">upgrades</a>). When you are moving a unit, every time you <em>enter</em> a tile you subtract an appropriate
	number of movement points, if the resulting number is negative you cannot enter that tile.
</p>

<p>
	Inside of your borders every tile is worth 1 movement point, and outside 2 movement points. If your starting position is on a tile
	owned by a player and the ending one is on a no man's land then that unit needs to have an armor equipped to be able to perform that move (if you start from no man's
	terrain and end on it that requirement is not present). That means you can cross a no man's terrain with a unarmored unit if you don't stop there.
</p>

<p>
	You can't move any units though anything drawn on the map except for your other units, your capital, cities, fortresses, and rails.

			<!--The only things mountains affect is where buildings can be placed and how units can move.--> Every time you cross the brown line (a level)
			the unit needs to stop at the very next tile, and the tiles with a brown line though the middle (slopes) have to be considered untraversable
			like lava or water.

			Railroads and bridges can essentially be treated as teleports.
			A unit can be moved from one of the tiles marked on the image to any other one of the same color.
			Look at the image on the left to see how a unit can be moved using a railroad.

<h3>shooting</h3>

<p>
	Every unit can shoot once per-turn, there is no limit on how many units can shoot every turn. Every shot costs 1 ammunition.
	It's usually a good idea to have at least 20 ammunition on hand, as large conflicts can require a lot of it. To lower the impact of the
	initial attack it's a good idea to protect your borders with not only units but also fortifications.
