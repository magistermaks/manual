<h1>TRADING</h1>
<h3>and gifts</h3>

<p>
	Trading in this game is allowed, even encouraged, but the whole system is based only on honor,
	there is no requirement for anyone to go through on their agreements and promises.
	You can send some resources to another player, but they can refuse to pay you for it.
</p>

<p>
	You can only send resources to countries with which you have direct contact with (the borders touch
	horizontally or vertically, or are connected by a bridge). If the only way between you and your
	trading partner is through another player you will need to strike an agreement with them to be your middleman.
</p>

<p>
	To send something (a, z, b, n, u, r, or m) to another player you have to denote it using the <em>trade arrow</em> in your player statistics,
	see it in the <a href="#statistics">statistics</a> chapter. Be very precise here, the game master has the right and duty
	to cancel any transfer that is in any way incorrect. You also cannot modify it after your turn ends.

		<p>
			At the end of the round, the game master executes all the
			valid trade arrows by moving the resources and erasing the arrows.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	If the transfer is impossible to carry out either because the connection between the two countries has been lost by the end of the round
	or because origin no longer has all the promised resources the arrow is cancelled and erased, even if its cyclical.
</p>

<p>
	You can have multiple resources on one arrow (<img loading="lazy" class="icon" alt="3m and 2a to X" title="3m and 2a to X" src="images/icons/trade_example_combined.png">).
</p>

<br>
<h3>cyclic transfers</h3>
<p>
	To save yourself some work with drawing an arrow every turn add a "times" clause
	to the arrow, (like x2, x3, x&infin;) then the game master would only decrement the number until it reaches 0 and erase the arrow after.
	You can cancel a cyclic transfer during your turn. For example: <img loading="lazy" class="icon" alt="2m to X for 3 turns" title="2m to X for 3 turns" src="images/icons/trade_example_times.png">
