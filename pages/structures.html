<h1>OTHER STRUCTURES</h1>
<h3>structrues that are not buildings</h3>

<p>
	There are also some other structures you are able to build that are not buildings in the traditional sense
	such as railroads and bridges. In most aspects they behave in the same way as all the other buildings.

		<p class="smaller">
			Allows you to "teleport" units between connected stations (as on the image)
			you can exit a station only by the walls not connected to rails.
			Station costs 2m, and a piece of rail 1m. You can connect rails to bridges. <!--Becouse of how cheap railroads are demolitshing them yealds no materials in return.-->

	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">bridges</h3>

		<p class="smaller">
			As oposed to railroads it has to be build in one go, and is considered a single structure.
			It cannot cross other bridges or turn. The maximum bridge length is 5 tiles. One tile costs 2m.
			When a single tile of a bridge is destroyed the whole bridge collapses (its a single structure).

	<div>
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">fortifications</h3>

		<p class="smaller">
			From left to right, fences (\FENCE\) 1m, walls <span class="nowrap">(\WALL\)</span> 3m, and coastal defenses <span class="nowrap">(\COASTAL\)</span> 2m.
			Learn more in the <a href="#units">units</a> and <a href="#water">water</a> chapters.
		</p>

		<p class="smaller">
			A fence can be upgraded to a wall by paying 2m.

	</div>
	<div>
		<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">mines</h3>

		<p class="smaller">
			Mines can only be build on top of deposits. Uranium mines cost 20m and produce a single piece of uranium when build,
			they also cannot be demolished. Red arrows show what happens when a mine is destroyed.

<p>
	Railroads can be build one tile at a time - you can always add some more rails and more stations but bridges are considered a single structure and have to be
	build in one go.
