<h1>WATER</h1>
<h3>water and lava</h3>

<p>
	The most basic way of getting over bodies of water is the bridge. It has a maximum length of 5 (or 10 with an upgrade) and has to be build in one go.
	It allows one to connect two shores in a straight line. A peculiar fact about the bridge is that its ownership (who can demolish it) is determined by the ownership
	of both edges. If one end of it is owned by one player and other by another the bridge cannot be demolished by either of them. You can only demolish a bridge if you own both sides
	or if one of the edges is connected with no man's territory. A good way of blocking a bridge from being build is making coastal defenses as you can't connect a bridge to a shore that has them build.

<p>
	Lava is similar to water, just slightly more red. There is no way to traverse lava pools, so don't even try.

<h3>ships</h3>

<p>
	Ships are made in a \H\ and can move on water. The table below shows the maximum amounts of goods that can be stored on a war ship of given
	tier. The tier 1 and 2 can be upgraded one tier up after being build by paying 6m while docked in a harbor.

<p>
	When a ship is constructed it must be placed next to the harbor so that it can be considered docked, it can be used starting with the next turn.
	Every ship is marked on the map with a number, that number must correspond to a entry in <em>ship list</em>. With every new ship constructed pick a
	number one larger than the current biggest one and add a new entry of that number to the ship list.
</p>

<p>
	A ship can do one of two things: shoot or move, similarly to units. If a ship doesn't shoot it also has the option to
	land troops OR build a pier OR move resources (only when docked/next to another ship). A ship is considered docked when
	it's next to a pier or harbor (diagonal connection doesn't count). When a ship is hit with ammunition it loses 1 armor, when that runs out it loses one tier
	(and all the resources that don't fit anymore) when the tier gets to 0 the ship sinks. When a bomb (or torpedo) hits a ship it immediately sinks.
</p>

<p>
	Ships can move only on water tiles <i>(duh!)</i> it can swim under bridges but can't stop there, it can however both swim though and stop on tiles with
	coastal defenses. The number of tiles a ship can traverse in a single turn is determined by its speed value from the table above.
</p>

<p>
	Landing can be performed only when the ship has a direct (not diagonal) connection with land (no coastal defenses between them).
	It allows you to get max 5 units from the ship onto the ground 1 tile (with diagonals) from the ship.
