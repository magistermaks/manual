<p>
	<b>Landing:</b> Landing can be performed only when the ship touches land (no coastal defenses between them).
	It allows you to get max 4 units from the ship onto the ground 1 tile (with diagonals) from the ship. You can also
	load max 4 units from those tiles back onto the ship, players without territory can also exchange resources with
	units standing in this area.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Piers:</b> A ship can build a pier 1 tile from itself (diagonals count). When you build a pier it automatically grants
	you 1 tile of territory, irrespective of who owned that tile before. Learn more in <a href="#building">building</a> chapter.
	If that tile is ever taken by another player the symbol on the pier changes respectively to match the new owner.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Resources:</b> While the ship is docked you can move any resources between the country that owns the pier or hearbor and your ship.
	You can also put people on a ship by moving them "into" the pier or harbor.
	If you don't want your units on a ship anymore you can do the same things in reverse.
	When two ships touch each other you can move any resources
	(and units) between them. Remember that you can only put unarmored units on ships. There are no limits on transferring resources and units.
	For a ship to be able to move it must have at least one unit on board, if a unit of another country tries to enter an empty ship
	the ship becomes theirs.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Shooting:</b> Ships can shoot in two ways, either using torpedoes (bombs) or ammunition. Torpedoes can only go in a straight line from the ship (up to 4 tiles) and always hit the first thing they encounter,
	be it another ship, a bridge, unit, or factory (yes they can go onto land). They work similarly to bombs but destroy only a single tile. Shooting with ammunition
	works similarly to doing the same with normal units, but has the range of 2 in all directions (including diagonally) and can't be blocked
	(it always hits the target, even if there is something in the way). A ship can use both ammunition and torpedoes in the same turn.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Defences:</b> A ship <em>can</em> stay on the same water tile the coastal defenses are located. but it can't land units
	nor build a pier there. Remember that there can be multiple coastal defenses on one water tile (up to the theoretical 4) but that is still treated
	as a single structure and can be destroyed with a single ammunition.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Shield:</b> Ships of tiers 2 and 3 can purchase a so called "shield module" for 5m while in a <i>harbor</i>. It allows you to shot down bombs that <em>fall</em> in a range
	of 2 tiles (without diagonals) with your own bombs (the ones stored on the ship).
</p>

<p>
	<b>Sinking:</b> When the ship sinks (or loses a tier causing some people to be lost as they don't fit anymore) and is within 2 tiles of any land, you can evacuate all the
	to-be-lost units onto the land, as long as they fit in that 2 tile area.
