<p>
	Every unit has a shooting range of 2 tiles (as marked on the image below). But you can't shoot through other units (yours or not) nor through fortifications or
	any other structrues and buildings (with some excpceptions mentioned later).

			The shooting range. The diagram on the right shows valid tagets with green (\F\, \FENCE\, two triangles) and some invalid
			(unreachable) oned in red.

<p>
	Armored units survive being shot, they then loose their armor, the next shot will kill them. So to kill a armored unit you
	would need to shot twice from two different units. Remember that you can only equip armor while inside your borders.

			The image on the left shows who the circle can shoot during their turn with green and who not with red.
			Fences block shooting in both directions while walls only in one. Remember that if a fortification is on
			your territory you can first demolish it and then shoot.

<h3>destroying buildings</h3>

<p>
	You can destroy buildings of your enemy (or your own if you want) by shooting them <strong>4 times in one turn</strong> with your units.
	There are some exceptions that require less lead to destroy.
</p>

<p>
	Those structures require only 2 ammunition:
	<ul>
		<li>Piers</li>
		<li>Bridges (you need to be shooting the same tile)</li>
		<li>Mines (of any type)</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	And those require only 1 ammunition:
	<ul>
		<li>All fortifications</li>
		<li>Rails (single piece)</li>
		<li>Railway stations</li>
	</ul>
</p>
