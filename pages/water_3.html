	<b>Shooting:</b> Ships can shoot in two ways, either using torpedoes (bombs) or ammunition. Torpedoes can only go in a straight line from the ship (up to 4 tiles) and always hit the first thing they encounter,
	be it another ship, a bridge, unit, or factory (yes they can go onto land). They work similarly to bombs but destroy only a single tile. Shooting with ammunition
	works similarly to doing the same with normal units, but has the range of 2 in all directions (including diagonally) and can't be blocked
	(it always hits the target, even if there is something in the way). A ship can use both ammunition and torpedoes in the same turn.

	<b>Shield:</b> Ships of tiers 2 and 3 can purchase a so called "shield module" for 5m while in a <i>harbor</i>. It allows you to shot down bombs that <em>fall</em> in a range
	of 2 tiles (without diagonals) with your own bombs (the ones stored on the ship).

			Shield module is denoted in the ship list by adding a letter 's' 
			in the tier column after the tier number. So Ship of tier 2 with 
			a shield would have a tier '2s'.

<p>
	<b>Sinking:</b> When the ship sinks (or loses a tier causing some people to be lost as they don't fit anymore) and is within 2 tiles of any land, you can evacuate all the
	to-be-lost units onto the land, as long as they fit in that 2 tile area (same area as defined by the ship's shooting range).
